# Neural Scholar Engine


**Neural Scholar Engine** is an advanced, AI-powered research and search interface designed to provide deep, accurate, and academically rigorous answers. Built with **Next.js** and powered by **Google's Gemini 3 Pro/Flash**, it goes beyond simple search to offer a specialized research assistant for students and professionals.

## 🚀 About The Project

Neural Scholar Engine bridges the gap between traditional search engines and AI assistants. It offers real-time web access, multi-step reasoning ("Chain of Thought"), and specialized modes for academic subjects.

### Key Features
*   **High Accuracy & Precision**: Delivers trustworthy, fact-based answers by cross-referencing multiple sources, ensuring information is highly accurate and reliable.
*   **Rich Media Integration**: Intelligently searches and curates the most relevant images and videos to visually enhance answers and provide verified context.
*   **Real-time Streaming**: Visualizes the AI's "thinking" process with granular status updates (e.g., "Searching Google...", "Reading sources...").
*   **Academic Modes**: Specialized agents for:
    *   **Physics (ISC Class 11/12)**: Solves numerical problems with strict 5-step CoT methodology.
    *   **Computer Science**: Generates Java code adhering to ISC syllabus standards.
    *   **Accounts/Commerce**: Specialized financial concepts assistance.
*   **Multimodal Search**: contextual understanding of images for solving problems or answering visual queries.
*   **Memory & Context**: Intelligent query rewriting to understand follow-up questions (e.g., "Show me more details about him").
